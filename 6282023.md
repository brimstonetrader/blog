Some slightly disappointing news on the front of Jamaican-Style Dominoes! The Ludeme for Dominoes is sort
of particular, intended for use in the Boneyard variant. Line 161 of the Deal Ludeme, that deals the 
dominoes, has the block:

		while (dealed < (count * 2))
		{
			final int index = context.rng().nextInt(toDeal.size());
			final int indexComponent = toDeal.getQuick(index);
			final Component component = components[indexComponent];
			final int currentPlayer = dealed % nbPlayers;
			Start.placePieces(context, handIndex.getQuick(currentPlayer) + (dealed / nbPlayers), component.index(), 1,
					Constants.OFF, Constants.OFF, Constants.UNDEFINED, false,
					SiteType.Cell);
			toDeal.removeAt(index);
			dealed++;
		}

What this loop does is deal the amount of dominoes specified, times 2. Jamaican-Style is essentially 
four player, and in general, it'd be nice to have this work for any amount of players. Luckily, this 
quick fix solves that issue.

		while (dealed < (count * context.game().players().count()))
		{
			final int index = context.rng().nextInt(toDeal.size());
			final int indexComponent = toDeal.getQuick(index);
			final Component component = components[indexComponent];
			final int currentPlayer = dealed % nbPlayers;
			Start.placePieces(context, handIndex.getQuick(currentPlayer) + (dealed / nbPlayers), component.index(), 1,
					Constants.OFF, Constants.OFF, Constants.UNDEFINED, false,
					SiteType.Cell);
			toDeal.removeAt(index);
			dealed++;
		}

This works fine and dandy. The problem is, Ludii uses a particular Ludeme for the "LineOfPlay" in a 
domino game. I have not been able to find a solution for using the available moves in this variant, 
filtering some possible options from the total line of play. Nevertheless,

The AI method in Ludii has some curious options. Throughout, there are references that I don't yet
