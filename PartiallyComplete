My strategy for learning Ludii over the first week was effective but left me feeling somewhat 
demotivated. Luckily I cannot be stopped. Ludii maintains a ["wishlist"](https://ludii.games/wishlist.php) where one
can find games that have not been implemented, but that the Ludii community has determined are
good and would be nice to have. I chose three games that I like and have played, greatly underestimating
the difficulty involved in implementing each. Regardless, I learned a lot, and had a good time. Next 
time I'm trying to learn a new thing I won't run up to the "unsolved problems" board and pick out several
like it's the Scholastic Book Fair. Anyway first up is

If you ask me the 20th century really got to going with the simultaneous discovery of Hex by Hein and 
Nash. It was the first game to have strategy based on maintaining connections between groups, a genre of 
abstract strategy games which has been thoroughly explored over the following hundred years. In Hex, you 
want a contiguous group (a bunch of nodes all orthogonally adjacent), that stretches across the entire 
board. This is cool, but it means a game on a standard 11x11 board goes by quick as all get-out, and 
no one wants to play Hex more than 2 or 3 times in a row. 

Lines of Action, which came out in the '80s, has a way cooler win condition, and it's easily playable on 
a chessboard with chess pieces. Easily in my top 5 games, just under Minecraft. One's initial nodes begin on the board, far apart from each other, and 
the goal is to unite all of one's pieces into a single group. The movement rules, as they have to,
make things difficult.
