- DOMINOES

This is one of my favorite games of all time. I learned to play it on a grey but not rainy Sunday in 
Gulfport, Florida, at the soccer fields. My uncle makes a habit of driving up there every Sunday, to 
stay grounded, and it's something of a tradition to play dominoes after soccer. I figured out the 
rules, despite I can't quite understand pure Patois, from watching. Jamaican-style dominoes is very 
particular: it feels mathematically correct. It can only be played by four players. This [website](https://jamaicans.com/dominoesjastyle/) explains the rules well. 

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_domino_games#Block_Game) lists the "Block Game" as 
having similar rules, and calls it "the simplest basic domino variant." A two player rendition has been 
created in [Ludii](https://ludii.games/details.php?keyword=Block). This program will be the base of my 
version of Jamaican-Style Dominoes, which I will be working on this week. I will update this blog post 
as I make progress, and if I have time, explore other domino variants to implement. The main reason 
that I want to do this is that both my uncle and I frequently play this game in times of leisure with 
this [app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mygdx.YardieStyleDominoes.android), the only one I know of that renders this particular ruleset, and its wait times and 
online capabilities are abysmal. I am hoping that Ludii can provide us both with a more pleasant gaming 
experience.
