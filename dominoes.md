- JAMAICAN-STYLE DOMINOES

This is one of my favorite games of all time. I learned to play it on a grey but not rainy Sunday in Gulfport, Florida, at the soccer fields. My uncle makes a habit of playing every Sunday, to stay grounded, and it's something of a tradition to play dominoes after soccer. Jamaican-style dominoes is very particular: it feels mathematically correct. It can only be properly played by four players (though my uncle at one point noted that two and seven player games are theoretically possible but boring in practice),
